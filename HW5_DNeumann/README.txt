We got started on Saturday, discussing what the exercises were asking and figuring
out how to go about doing them. We then did some work separately.
I figured out how to do the matrix operations in python. 
Collin wrote the code for the plots and for exercise 3 (which was mostly an 
extension of what I had written the day before.) Collin then wrote the captions for
the graphs, including answering some of the posed questions.

The homework was about fitting models to data. More specifically in regard to linear
and quadratic fits, and constructing an objective function that represents the quality of the fit.
The hardest part for us was translating our understandings of linear algebra python & numpy code.
